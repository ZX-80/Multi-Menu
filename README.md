## Navigating :world_map: 

Navigation can be done with either controller, or the console buttons:

| Action               | Controller | Button
|----------------------|------------|-------
|Previous file         | Right/Up   | 1
|Next file             | Left/Down  | 2
|Select file/directory | Press      | 3/4

## Protocol & Commands :mega:
The menu communicates with the Pico through port `$FF` and memory address `$2800`. It supports the following commands: 

- Next `($1 -> Port $FF)` = Place the next filename (null terminated) in `$2802`. The filename can be up to 255 characters long
- Select `($2 -> Port $FF)` = Reset the Channel F, and load the currently selected file
- Previous `($4 -> Port $FF)` = Place the previous filename (null terminated) in `$2802`. The filename can be up to 255 characters long
- None `($8 -> Port $FF)` = Must be sent before another Next/Previous will register. This prevents the menu changing more than once per input
	
## Text Encoding :speech_balloon:

</p>

The menu currently supports [code page 437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437), not UTF-8. This can cause unexpected encoding errors for non-ascii characters, depending on your operating system. I may change this in future, so only rely on the ASCII subset for now.
